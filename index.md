### RESEARCH  EXPERIENCE 

##### Unsupervised Learning-Based Depth Estimation of Monocular Endoscopy

Supervised by Prof. Qiang Li, in Britton Chance Center for Biomedical Photonics	

WNLO, HUST



- Improved depth estimation in monocular endoscopy and outperformed the existing work by implementing Zero-Mean Normalized Cross Correlation to measure the patch-wise similarities, implementing Peak Signal to Noise Ratio to measure the pixel-wise accuracies and creating a novel adaptive smoothness loss.
- Generated monocular depth estimation for endoscopic images with open-source repositories (monodepth2 and SfMLearner).
- Generated sparse surface reconstruction of endoscopic images with open-source Python/ C++ Structure-from-Motion pipelines (Colmap, OpenSfM, Bundler, etc).
- Reviewed >100 papers about augmented reality in robotic surgery and unsupervised depth estimation methods; summarized and categorized them; wrote a report (augmented reality in robotic surgery).

##### Mesoscopic Perovskite Solar Cells

- Advised by Prof. Hu Yue, in Michael Gr√§tzel Center for Mesoscopic Solar Cells
  Leading a science popularization team; developing a set of optoelectronic experiments for primary and middle school students.
- Learned to fabricate printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with high stability.
- Reviewed papers and participated in the revision of a paper.

### EXCHANGE EXPERIENCE
